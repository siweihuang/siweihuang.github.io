      en: "There was an even longer-term benefit to my decision. My fellow interviewee, Betty Eveillard, had a long, successful career in investment banking. We often ran into each other professionally. Decades after we navigated that treacherous day of interviews, we serve together on the board of the Frick Collection, an art museum on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where she became chairperson. Those early encounters and friendships have a way of reappearing throughout your life.",

He took me to dinner and explained how the firm worked.",
