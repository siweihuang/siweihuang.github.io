            "Fear comes from the selfish idea of cutting one's self off from the universe",
            "Live your own life. That is to say, where you are, as you are, with what you are, and with who you are. Accept the sitation in which you find yourself and try, at the same time, to adapt to it. You cannot escape from it."
            ,"It is only when we give complete attention to a problem, and solve it immediately - never carrying it over to the next day, the next minute, that there is solitude.",
            "A mind that is burdened with the past is a sorrowful mind.",

            "There is no master, there is no instructor, there is no person to tell you what you must do.",
            "You cannot expect anything, because the expectation is within you, and what you are waiting for is dependent on external forces.",
            "We should never try to follow another's path for that is his way, not yours. Your way is the best for you, but that is no sign it is the best for another."
